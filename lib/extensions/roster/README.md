# Roster Versioning

The XMPP Roster Etension is an implementation of the **XEP-0237** (Roster Versioning) specification, which defines the requirements for managing presence subscriptions in the context of XMPP communication. This extension enhances this client by enabling the retrieval and sending of presence subscription requests and approvals.

## Features

- **Subscription Request**: This extension allows users to send subscription requests to other users, indicating their interest in receiving presence updates from them.
- **Subscription Approval**: Users can approve incoming subscription requests, allowing the requesting user to receive their presence updates.
- **Subscription Rejection**: The extension facilitates the rejection of subscription requests, preventing unwanted users from receiving presence information.
- **Presence Unsubscription**: Users can also unsubscribe from receiving presence updates from contacts they had previously approved.
